## 🚀 Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🖼️ **Image Detection** | Analyze static images for deepfake manipulation |
| 🎞️ **Video Detection** | Process video files with temporal aggregation |
| 📷 **Live Webcam** | Real-time detection from webcam feed |
| 🖥️ **Screen Capture** | Monitor any on-screen content (social media, websites) |
| 🧠 **MesoNet CNN** | Lightweight face-based deepfake classification |
| 🔍 **Explainability** | Gemini-powered human-readable explanations |
| 🧩 **Modular Design** | Each pipeline works independently |

## ⚡️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- pip
- Webcam (for live detection)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/omtripathi52/deepguard.git
cd deepguard

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate (Linux/Mac)
# source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🎯 Usage

### 🖼️ Image Detection

```bash
python -m core.image_pipeline --path face_0.jpg
# or
python -m core.image_pipeline --image face_0.jpg
```

### 🎞️ Video Detection

```bash
python -m core.video_pipeline --path "path/to/video.mp4"
# or
python -m core.video_pipeline --video "path/to/video.mp4"
```

### 📷 Webcam (Real-Time)

```bash
python -m core.live_pipeline
```
> Press `q` to quit

### 🖥️ Screen Capture

```bash
python -m core.screen_pipeline
```
> Press `Ctrl+C` to stop

## 🔐 Gemini Integration

DeepGuard is designed with **Gemini API integration** for AI-based reasoning and explanation of detection results.

### How It Works

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Prompt Design** | Structured prompts for detection reasoning |
| **Model Discovery** | Automatic Gemini model enumeration |
| **Fallback System** | Deterministic explanations when API unavailable |

### Configuration

```bash
# Set your Gemini API key (optional - fallback works without it)
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

### Explanation Output Example

```
The system flagged this video as a potential deepfake with 84% confidence.
This may be due to subtle facial inconsistencies, unnatural motion patterns,
or artifacts commonly introduced by synthetic media generation.
```

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **TensorFlow/Keras** | Deep learning framework |
| **MTCNN** | Multi-task face detection |
| **MesoNet** | Deepfake classification (WIFS 2018) |
| **OpenCV** | Image/video processing |
| **mss** | Cross-platform screen capture |
| **Google Gemini** | AI-powered explanations |

---

## 🧩 Use Cases

- ✅ Social media deepfake monitoring
- ✅ Content moderation pipelines
- ✅ Media forensics & verification
- ✅ Browser or application integration
- ✅ AI safety and trust research

---

## 🎬 Note on Movie & Cinematic Content

DeepGuard may occasionally flag **movie scenes or cinematic footage** as potential deepfakes due to:

- Heavy visual effects (VFX)
- CGI-based face enhancement
- Cinematic color grading
- Compression artifacts

> **This is expected behavior.** The system is intentionally conservative, prioritizing safety over permissiveness.

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

DeepGuard is a **research prototype**. Predictions may be affected by:

- Video quality
- Lighting conditions
- Compression
- Artistic or cinematic effects

**Use as a decision-support tool, not as an absolute authority.**
